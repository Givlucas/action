# Introduction
Action is an experimental task / documentation framework that uses
directed acyclic meta graphs to organise tasks based on their dependancies 
on others. These graphs, which we will call "action graphs", break down
the relationship between what actions need to be completed to create
the desired results. As well as providing a framework for keeping track 
of what actions need to be done Action seeks to keep track of the why. 
By enforcing a documentation structure for each action, details about 
the why and how decisions were made and excuted allows teams to aduit 
the result of their efforts in an agile way. Aditionally Action provides
a rigid structure for describe the current progress state of a action.
